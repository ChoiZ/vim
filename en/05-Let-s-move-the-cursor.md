# Let's move the cursor!

To move the cursor, you can use the arrows, but I advise you to use `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` instead.

`h` move the cursor one character to the left

`j` moves the cursor to the lower line

`k` moves the cursor to the upper line

`l` moves the cursor to the right

Numbers can also be used to move faster.

`8h` will move the cursor 8 characters to the left

`6j` will move the cursor down by 6 characters

`4k` will move the cursor up by 4 characters

`2l` will move the cursor 2 characters to the right

Let's move the cursor even faster to the beginning or end of the line or file.

`0` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line we can also use `^`

`$` moves the cursor to the end of the line

`gg` moves the cursor to the beginning of the file we can also use `:1`

`G` moves the cursor to the end of the file we can also use `:$`
