# VIM

By default, VIM starts in Normal mode.

In this mode, key presses don't insert text in the document.

To insert text you'll need to switch to Insert mode.

The most used modes are:
- Normal mode: You can enter all the normal editor commands
- Visual mode: Like Normal mode, but movement commands extend a highlighted area. "-- VISUAL --" is shown at the bottom of the window with showmode option activated
- Insert mode: The text you type is insert into the buffer. "-- INSERT -- " is shown at the bottom of the window with showmode option activated
- Command line mode: You can enter one line of text at the bottom of the window, this is for Ex commands ":", the pattern search commands "?" and "/", and the filter commands "!"
